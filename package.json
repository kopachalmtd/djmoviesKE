A — User Flow (How the system works)

User signs up / logs in

User deposits money (manual M-Pesa, PayHero STK Push, etc.)

System adds money to their balance (KES).

On the website, user sees:

🎞 Movie List (fetched from Telegram bot or your JSON)

💰 Balance icon (e.g., “Balance: KES 50”)

When user selects a movie:

If balance ≥ 10 → Unlock movie, reduce balance by 10

If balance < 10 → Show “Deposit to Continue”
